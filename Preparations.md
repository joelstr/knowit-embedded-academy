# Preparations
Before the course start a few things need to be prepared on your computer.
- We will use av DevKit for an STM32-processor. To easily get started with development we will use their own IDE, whic is a Eclipse variant. You will need to install [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
- We will use qemu to emulate an arm architecture, for this you will need to install Windows Subsystem for Linux [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). This as also useful for compiling and running C-code.
- If you haven't coded C in a while, have a look at the examples in Pre-course folder. We will go through these in the pre-course session.
