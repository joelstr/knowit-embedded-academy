# Embedded development
The embedded academy intends to give C developers more knowledge about embedded system design. The academy will touch points such as the processors components and how to read the processor manual, how a real time operating system works, common communication interfaces and some basic electronics. During the course you will get the opportunity to work on some actual hardware while learning the parts of the course.

For any inquiries regarding the course, please direct them to Joel Strand at joel.strand@knowit.se

## Inteded audience
Precondition for the course is knowledge in C programming, if you are feeling rusty, or maybe know similar languages but not C, there will be an opportunity to refresh your basics before the course starts

## Course arrangement
The course will consist of four parts, Intoduction, Assembler and compilers, Electronics and Hardware interfaces and Communication interfaces. Each part will be a four hour session with combination of lecture and practical work.

## Session schedule
Course will be conducted from 16.00 to ~20.00. Lectures will be held online but the lab part will require hardware which will be available on each participants respective site.
