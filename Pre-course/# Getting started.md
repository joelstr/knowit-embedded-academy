# Getting started
## Setting up environment
- Install your favorite IDE, I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install Windows Subsystem for Linux [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
## Running code
In the linux terminal, run the following commands on your c-file.

`gcc -c hello_world.c -o hello_world.o`

`gcc -o hello_world hello_world.o`

`./hello_world`

If using VSCode you could also install the extension [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) which will add a play button in the top right corner of the file in your editor, which you can use to run your code.
